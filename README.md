![website demo](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ1VCsaXxZMSptNU3fBeDXEVyggGARj52NCmmnZFffsFP)

## TODOs

1. Store fetched NFTs in context to avoid constant API pinging
2. Don't give face when loading
3. Don't let generating too many per day (cache)
4. Button to refresh the faces (pulls all the faces again)
5. Don't show the faces with no face
6. Better UX / UI when minting. Say it is minting. What if it fails to mint? Show Try again
7. Approve once and for all button
8. Don't let them get face when minting or getting a face
9. (Optional) like minting NFTs in Gitcoin, give animation here
10. Do not show / fetch all the faces. Someone may have too many NFTs, do the background fetches and store in state and load as they press "Load More" / scroll down
11. Do not show the lent out ones in the lend tab (only show the ones you can lend)
12. Do not show the borrowed ones in the rent tab (only show the ones you can borrow)
13. Only let approve all, if hasn't approved all before
14. (Optional) let approve individual ones
15. Show the maxDuration, borrowPrice, nftPrice on the UI
16. Do not show the faces that do not have a valid uri
17. Show the faces in the most recent minted order
18. Add a button to refresh the faces
19. UI for fetching faces (show they are loading)
20. (Optional) cache faces for user sessions
21. (Optional) authenticate users with their crypto wallet signature
22. Better Lend one UI
23. Fix the production build scrollbar issue
24. ! Make it responsive
25. Can you make it mobile / non-crypto friendly?
26. (Optional) If GAN faces are in mainnet, add them to backlog for future batch mint
27. When clicking on a picture, open the IPFS picture
28. Add another tab to remove the lent out NFTs from the platform
29. Move to ethers.js before it is too late
